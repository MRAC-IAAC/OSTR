# Structure Code and Methodology
# Steps for Drawing Bot
#
#
#
# 1.. Load Image // Read real time piCamera + Canny Output // Draw Outlines
# 2.. From grayscale image create pixel value matrix
# 3.. Convert matrix to metric system
# 4.. Scan line by line to fine 255 and then look around for more
# 5.. Establish set of commands to decide for intersections
# 6.. Translate to Arduino
# 7.. get gcode
