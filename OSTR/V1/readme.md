Open Source Turtle Robot (OSTR)
============

![Open Source Turtle Robot](images/OSTR.JPG) 

Robotics is the exciting intersection of a number of engineering fields including mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science.  This project was designed as the basis for a two-day workshop for high school age students to introduce them to engineering principles and giving them a jumping off point for exploring their interests further.  There is something for everyone here, even if it is just for the art it creates. The design goals were:

- Easy to build.
- Easy to program.
- Did something interesting.
- Low-cost so participants could take it home and continue to learn.

With those goals in mind, here were a couple of the design choices:

- Arduino compatible for ease of programming.
- 4xAA battery power for cost and availability.
- Stepper motors for accurate motion.
- 3D Printed for ease of customization.
- Pen plotting with Turtle graphics for interesting output.
- Open Source so you could make one of your own!

A kit for this project is [available on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/open-source-turtle-robot-ostr/).

- [Bill of Materials](BOM.md)


Design Files
------------
The electronics were designed using Open Source [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/). Design files are located in the [electronics](electronics/) folder.  You can oogle the [schematic](electronics/project.pdf).

All 3D STL files located in the [mechanical/STL](mechanical/STL) folder. They were design were designed using:

- [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), files located in the [mechanical/OpenSCAD](mechanical/OpenSCAD) folder.
- [FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/), files located in the [mechanical/FreeCad](mechanical/FreeCad) folder.
- [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1PzjMSYXagP-oser/editv2) 

Firmware
--------
This project is programed using the Open Source [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). The firmware is located in the [firmware](firmware/) folder.  Instructions for setting up the Arduino enviroment for the Adafruit Trinket Pro are at [https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-pro-trinket](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-pro-trinket).
